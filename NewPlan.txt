I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end. Make sure you fix all the linting, compilation or validation issues after successful implementation of the plan.

### Observations

The current Game Theory Simulator is a solid Next.js application with basic game theory concepts implemented using shadcn/ui components. It features a bento grid layout, theme switching, and IBM Plex Mono font. The existing simulations (Prisoner's Dilemma, Nash Equilibrium, Evolutionary Game) are functional but basic. The user wants to enhance this with more advanced game theory concepts, better graphical representations, and creative animations while maintaining the current tech stack and design principles.

### Approach

I'll enhance the existing Game Theory Simulator by adding 8 new advanced game theory concepts with rich visualizations and animations. The plan includes implementing interactive network games, cooperative game theory with Shapley values, mechanism design, behavioral economics, signaling games, matching theory, voting systems, and repeated games. Each new component will feature sophisticated SVG-based visualizations, smooth animations using CSS transforms and transitions, and interactive elements that respond to user input in real-time. All enhancements will use only shadcn/ui components and maintain the IBM Plex Mono font while adding creative micro-interactions and visual feedback.

### Reasoning

I explored the current codebase structure by examining the package.json, main page components, layout configuration, and existing game theory implementations. I analyzed the component architecture, styling approach with Tailwind CSS, and the bento grid layout system. I reviewed the current simulations to understand the implementation patterns and identified opportunities for enhancement with more advanced concepts and visualizations.
