I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end. Make sure you fix all the linting, compilation or validation issues after successful implementation of the plan.

### Observations

I need to create a comprehensive plan for a game theory simulator frontend application. The project requires a modern React-based setup with shadcn/ui components, IBM Plex Mono font, theme switching capabilities, and a responsive bento layout. Since this is a new project in an empty directory, I'll structure it as a Next.js application with TypeScript for optimal development experience and performance.

### Approach

I'll create a Next.js application with TypeScript as the foundation, integrating shadcn/ui for components, implementing three distinct themes with a theme switcher, and building interactive game theory simulations including Prisoner's Dilemma, Nash Equilibrium calculator, and other classic game theory scenarios. The layout will use a responsive bento grid that adapts from multi-column on desktop to single-column on mobile, with IBM Plex Mono as the primary font for a technical, academic aesthetic.

### Reasoning

I analyzed the empty project directory and researched the requirements for shadcn/ui setup, game theory simulator examples, responsive bento layouts, and IBM Plex Mono font implementation. Based on this research, I determined that a Next.js application with TypeScript would be the optimal foundation for this frontend-only game theory simulator.
